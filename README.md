This is an implementation of Login API.
The login , logout and session tracking has been managed at server-side using "/login" , "/logout" , and "/getsession" routes.

The public folder has client-side files to demonstrate and test implementation.
To see the user-side implementation , run the project using "node index.js" or "nodemon".
